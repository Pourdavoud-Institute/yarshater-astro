# Yarshater Center Website (Front-end)

This repository contains the front-end code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for the [UCLA Yarshater Center](https://yarshater.ucla.edu/) website, part of the UCLA College [Division of Humanities](https://humanities.ucla.edu/). Serving as the "presentation layer" of a "headless" architecture, the codebase uses the Node.js-based Astro web framework to prerender a static site via a build step. The "content layer" is handled separately in a [Sanity Studio app](https://github.com/Pourdavoud-Institute/sanity-studio) and is exposed to the front-end via a query language API.

Use this project to make changes to template files, add new site integrations, or set up a local development environment for testing features / fixes.

## Features

- [Astro v5](https://astro.build/) TypeScript-based static site generator with various first- and third-party plugins and built-in [Vite](http://vite.dev/) server
- Astro's fully-typed [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) loading headless data from the [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) content platform (accessed with Sanity client + [GROQ queries](https://www.sanity.io/docs/content-lake/how-queries-work))
- [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/) scripts to transpile, bundle, and minify CSS
- [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.dev/start-here) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for lightweight page interactivity
- [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) static site search indexing with built-in live search UI
- Fluid typography scaling and spacing with [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/)
- Formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) + Astro plugin
- Design elements and icons based on the [UCLA Design Systems](https://designsystem.brand.ucla.edu/) style guide

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

To get started locally, ensure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and the [npm package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system. The easiest way to do this is by downloading Node, nvm (the Node version manager), and npm all together via the [Node downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) (JavaScript runtime environment)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (version control)

### 2. Clone repository

In the terminal, navigate to your projects directory and `git clone` the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Pourdavoud-Institute/yarshater-astro.git
cd yarshater-astro
```

### 3. Install dependencies with `npm`

```sh
npm install
```

### 4. Run scripts

The project's `package.json` file registers the following scripts:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Script | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `npm run dev` | Starts the Astro dev server. |
| `npm run index` | Uses `pagefind` to index all marked pages for search. |
| `npm run build` | Builds site to `dist` output directory and runs `index` (see above). |
| `npm run preview` | Previews the *built* site files in a local environment. |
