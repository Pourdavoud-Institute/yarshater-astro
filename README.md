# Pourdavoud Institute Website (Front End)

This repository contains code that builds the front end files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for the [UCLA Pourdavoud Institute](https://pourdavoud.ucla.edu/) website. It does not contain any code or settings for the Sanity.io headless content management system, which is tracked elsewhere. Use this project to track changes to template files, add new site integrations, or set up a local development environment.

## Features

- [Astro v5](https://astro.build/) TypeScript-based static site generator with various first- and third-party plugins and built-in [Vite](http://vite.dev/) server
- Astro's fully-typed [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) loading headless data from [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) content platform (accessed with Sanity client + GROQ queries)
- [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/) scripts to transpile, bundle, and minify CSS
- [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.dev/start-here) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for lightweight interactivity
- Fluid typography scaling and spacing with [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/)
- Formatting ([Prettier](https://prettier.io/)) and linting ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/) + Astro plugin)
- Design elements and icons based on the [UCLA Design Systems](https://designsystem.brand.ucla.edu/) style guide
